<p> Earlier this year, in February, I attended my first Hackathon hosted by Symantec in Mountain View. Here is the project that we worked on that day. </p>

<p> The theme of the Hackathon was to produce a project related to either civil rights or human rights. My group chose to go down the path of civil rights. Our website aimed to educate the public about the Constitution of the United States of America.</p>

Reflections:
July 6, 2017:
I still think that it depends on what the robot is used for
I am both excited and nervous for the future of robots because I think that robots can help us solve a lot of problems.
